# Only excluding system/temporary files that shouldn't be in version control

# System generated files
Thumbs.db
.DS_Store
desktop.ini

# Temporary files
*.tmp
*.temp
~*

# Note: All .aia files, screenshots, and project assets are intentionally tracked
# to ensure complete project preservation and sharing
